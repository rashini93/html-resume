<h1>About Me</h1>

<p>
  Greetings! I'm Rashini, a versatile professional with a dynamic background in
  law and technology. Allow me to share a bit about my journey.
</p>
<p>
  In 2017, I proudly graduated with a Bachelor's degree in Law from the esteemed
  University of London. This educational foundation laid the groundwork for my
  subsequent ventures in the legal field.
</p>

<p>
  In 2020, I took a pivotal step by becoming an Attorney-at-Law in Sri Lanka.
  Being a member of the Bar Association of Sri Lanka, I immersed myself in the
  intricacies of legal practice, gaining invaluable experience over two years at
  a private law firm.
</p>

<p>
  Seeking new horizons, I set out on a transformative journey that led me to the
  vibrant tech hub of Singapore. In 2023, I embraced a bold career shift,
  becoming a Full Stack Developer. My expertise now encompasses a wide array of
  programming languages and technologies, including HTML, CSS, JavaScript,
  Python, React, as well as frameworks like Node.js, Angular.js, Bootstrap, PHP,
  and Laravel.
</p>

<p>
  This fusion of legal acumen and technical proficiency allows me to approach
  challenges with a unique perspective, leveraging both worlds to find
  innovative solutions. Whether it's crafting elegant code or dissecting complex
  legal issues, I thrive on the intersection of law and technology.
</p>

<p>
  I am passionate about building bridges between the legal and tech realms,
  harnessing their combined potential to create impactful solutions. Join me on
  this exciting journey as we explore the limitless possibilities at this
  intersection.
</p>
